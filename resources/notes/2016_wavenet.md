# WaveNet: A Generative Model for Raw Audio

## Introduction

*Can we use neural networks to generate coherent audio waveforms ?*
Constrained to high temporal resolution : at least 16000 samples per second for speech synthesis
Usage of **autoregressive generative models** to address this problematic.
*WaveNet* is hereby described, and asserted better than all state-of-the-art TTS methods.
