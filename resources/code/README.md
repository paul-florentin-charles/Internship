# Instructions

Put your audio files in *audio* directory (not necessary, it is 
merely cleaner).

Place your model files next to the python files.

There should be 3 model files for each model :
* <model_name>.data
* <model_name>.index
* <model_name>.meta

Just type <model_name> whenever using python scripts to designate 
your model.
